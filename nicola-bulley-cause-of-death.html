Always smiling and laughing. Loved animals and nature. She was kind and generous. She was the most beautiful person inside and out.”</strong></p><p>He also thanked everyone who helped in the search for his wife, and said he hoped that her death would raise awareness of the dangers of cold water.</p><p>He said: <strong>“Please be careful around water. It can kill you in seconds. Don’t take any risks. Don’t let this happen to anyone else.”</strong></p><p>Nicola Bulley’s mother, Christine, said: <strong>“She was my daughter, my friend, my confidante. Always there for me. So much to live for. She had so many plans for the future.”<br></strong></p><p>She also urged people to be respectful of her daughter’s memory and not to spread rumours or false information about her death.</p><p><strong>“Please don’t believe everything you read on social media.
