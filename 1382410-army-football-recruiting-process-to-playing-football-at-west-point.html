The&nbsp;<a title="starting lineup" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">starting lineup</a> for Army's game with Ball State&nbsp;this week lists&nbsp;eight freshmen and sophomores&nbsp;among the defensive starters. &nbsp;I asked Coach Ellerson about recruiting for the defense:</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bleacherreport.com/images/pixel.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>"There are some things&nbsp;about playing on the defensive side of the ball; there are fewer people in the population who can do those things."</p><p>Coach Ellerson went on to describe two&nbsp;positions on the defense he finds very hard to find players for:</p><p>"There are fewer guys who can play corner.&nbsp;That&nbsp;might be the most discriminating skill in all of athletics, guys who can can&nbsp;go out on the&nbsp;corner, have someone run straight at them while they run backwards and try to stay inside or on top, or outside.&nbsp; It is a skill-intensive, athletically demanding position&nbsp;and no one has too&nbsp;many of them; it is hard to find those guys."</p><p>The coach went on to say that the defensive line is another tough position to recruit players because of the dual role&nbsp;to rush the passer and&nbsp;stop the run:</p><p>"It is hard to find defensive linemen who can rush the passer.&nbsp;We have talked about how undersized we are relative to our opponent(s). To be able to be effective in that&nbsp;environment and physical&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;cancel gaps in the run game and still rush the passer, that is the most exhausting thing in the game of football, is rushing the passer."</p><p>Coach Ellerson went on to describe how&nbsp;defensive linemen are often less effective late in games:</p><p>"You see points in the fourth quarter, all of a sudden. They (the offense) didn't get any faster. They did not get&nbsp;smarter. They are not throwing the ball any better. What happens is the&nbsp;pass rush&nbsp;gets tired."</p><p>Army Assistant Coach John Brock described the technology tool that they use to spot and track prospects across the national recruiting effort that Army pursues.&nbsp; Each of the Black Knight assistant coaches have a recruiting section of the country to visit and work on.&nbsp; About half of the coaching staff travels&nbsp;on Thursdays and Fridays to their territories to visit high schools before heading back to the&nbsp;team for the game on Saturday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Coach Brock&nbsp;described how time-consuming it can be to&nbsp;search the Internet to find information about thousands of prospects.&nbsp; Army has developed&nbsp;a data mining software program that searches for&nbsp;basic information about prospective players, including&nbsp;team rosters, performances in other sports (such as track team times) and even summer&nbsp;football camps that players may have participated in.&nbsp;&nbsp;The program cross references data to combine information from multiple&nbsp;sources to produce a printout of players sorted by recruiting territory.&nbsp;Coach Brock described the time saving value of this technology:</p><p>"This can be a starting point, a list; it can be 3,000 guys that play football and have some of these numbers that we are looking for. It cuts down time. The coaches don't have to worry about spending time getting that&nbsp;information; now they&nbsp;have the names in front of them and we can&nbsp;get transcripts and move on from there.&nbsp;&nbsp;For our coaches, it saves a lot of time on the front end&nbsp;in developing&nbsp;your&nbsp;suspect list&nbsp;and then&nbsp;narrowing that down to a prospect list with&nbsp;the information that we hold value."</p><p>Later in the program, Army head coach Rich Ellerson stated that the&nbsp;recruiting software Army uses was originally&nbsp;developed when he coached at Cal Poly, in California, a state with&nbsp;nearly 30 million people.&nbsp; The software&nbsp;allowed the staff to&nbsp;canvass for prospects as wide as they could.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the staff moved to West Point four years ago, they upgraded the software to cover the entire country for recruiting.&nbsp; Coach Ellerson commented:</p>"To canvass as many folks as possible, to find those guys who belong, that can play at this level, have the character and intellect&nbsp;to prosper at West Point and then be in for what we are, want the destination...and&nbsp;can play Division One football. They have that level of athleticism and explosiveness.&nbsp; Whenever you are looking at 17 year olds, the crystal ball is not always clear.&nbsp; Anything we can do to validate, what we think we see when we see them play the game."<p>The Black Knight coach continued to describe the process of evaluating thousands of prospects to find the very few who can play and meet the requirements of the Academy:</p><p>"We have this monstrous list of suspects that we reduce over time to prospects,&nbsp;then the prospects come to me and I convert them to recruits; it is a progression.&nbsp; To become a recruit, you have to have the intellect, character and player ability we are looking for.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you find that guy who belongs here—we have 15-20 guys who visit every weekend—90 percent of those who come in are saying 'this is it, exactly.'"</p><p>It is a long way from tracking years of high school play, visits to homes, visits to West Point, possibly a year at the <a title="US Military Academy Prep School" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Military Academy Prep School</a>, R-Day, and "Beast Barracks" before a&nbsp;player may have a chance to run onto&nbsp;Blaik Field at Michie Stadium as a Black Knight.&nbsp; As far as measuring the process, Coach Ellerson commented:</p><p>&nbsp;"If we have done our evaluations correct upfront, we don't receive many no's."&nbsp;</p><p>Ken Kraetzer covers Army football for WVOX in New Rochelle, NY and Sons of the American Legion Radio.
