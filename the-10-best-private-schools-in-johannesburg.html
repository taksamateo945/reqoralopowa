Of the over 50 popular private high schools in Joburg, there’s a clear distinction in the quality of education they each offer.

They have various sporting facilities, which their students train and compete with. These facilities though built at various times are well maintained. They include two swimming pools, netball and tennis courts, an indoor gymnasium hall, four squash courts, and a rock climbing facility. However, the emphasis is not a win-at-all-costs attitude.

The school has a policy of limiting each class to fewer than 25 pupils so that each student can be noticed, nurtured, and allowed to excel. To the management of the school, they don’t count pupils. Instead, they make their pupils count. This has made it a highly sought-after school in Johannesburg, with limited entry opportunities for students every year.</p><p>Though it is a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>small school with less than 600 pupils</a> all year round, the school’s vision for giving quality education is in no way limited as you can find one of the best facilities for learning in this school.

Johannesburg Muslim School</strong></h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/as225086bc66d2b57-1024x768-1-e1622299834428.jpg alt="johannesburg muslim school" width=1000 height=750 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><ul><li><strong>Year Founded</strong>: 1990</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 33 Years</li><li><strong>Founder</strong>: Unknown</li><li><strong>Location (Address)</strong>: Corner Bree and Burgersdorp Streets, Fordsburg, Johannesburg, 2092, South Africa</li><li><strong>Boarding or Not</strong>: Day</li><li><strong>Gender</strong>: Mixed</li><li><strong>Curriculum</strong>: Secular/South African and Islamic Curriculum</li></ul><p>If not the only top Islamic school in Joburg, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Johannesburg Muslim School</a> sets the pace for other Muslim schools. Also, one of the best private schools in Johannesburg, the idea for creating the school was in 1989, and by January 1990, it became a reality. The school was created to provide an enabling educational ground where both Islamic and secular knowledge can impact young Muslims in the right balance. Thus, they operate an integrated system that offers both secular education as embedded in the Gauteng Department of Education curriculum and an Islamic curriculum that all schools in the Association of Muslim Schools in South Africa follow.</p><p>The school has a separate pre-school in Mayfair, which caters to the educational needs of the nursery, intermediate, and Grade R students. In contrast, the high school section is located in Fordsburg, where grade 1-12 pupils learn. With about 1000 pupils, the management of Johannesburg Muslim School has proven convincingly that it’s no fluke for them to be ranked one of the best schools in the Gauteng region and also one of the top 5 feeder schools by the University of the Witwatersrand despite being from a previously educationally disadvantaged community.</p><p>Though an Islamic school, the school is open to admitting pupils from other religions, all races, and ethnicities. However, all applicants must comply with their admission criteria and fulfill all requirements.</p><h3><strong>9.

In its over 100 years of existence, the school has trained over 1100 students who pursue diverse careers in different walks of life.</p><p>Aside from academics, the school also emphasizes sports and has facilities for tennis, basketball, swimming, cricket, soccer, netball, hockey basketball, athletics, and softball. The school also supports their students participating in dance, art, photography, mosaic, Tai Chi coding, singing, debating, and other cultural programs which they mapped out. They can do all these because they have well-built facilities which are properly maintained. Some of these facilities include 4 netball courts, 2 outside basketball courts, an Indoor sports center, Design and Technology center, 2 AV rooms, 5 soccer fields, a music center, 3 cricket ovals, a fully equipped gymnasium hall, heated swimming pool, etc.</p><p>Being over 100 years old, it will be out of the ordinary if Sacred Heart College, Johannesburg, does not have a list of notable alumni. They can proudly boast of having trained Sacred Heart College, Johannesburg, Simphiwe Tshabalala (CEO of Standard Bank Group), Wandile Molebatsi (actor, producer), John Charles Daly (Radio and Television personality), Ruli Diseko (CEO of Thakadu Group), and many others.</p><h3><strong>10.
