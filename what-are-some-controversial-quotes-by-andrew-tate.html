Tate has often been criticized for his views, which many consider to be offensive and harmful.</p><p>Tate’s controversial quotes have sparked outrage and led to calls for him to be banned from social media. He has been accused of promoting hate speech and inciting violence against women, minorities, and the LGBTQ+ community. Despite facing backlash for his comments, Tate has continued to defend his views and has even claimed that his statements are taken out of context.</p><p>In this article, we will explore some of the most controversial quotes by Andrew Tate.

One of his most infamous quotes is, “Depression is a choice.” This statement has caused outrage among mental health advocates and professionals, who argue that depression is a serious mental illness that requires treatment, not a choice.</p><p>Tate has defended his statement, claiming that depression is a mindset that can be overcome through positive thinking and hard work. He argues that people who are depressed are simply choosing to focus on negative thoughts and emotions, rather than taking control of their lives and making positive changes.</p><p>However, mental health professionals warn that depression is not a choice, and that it is a complex condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, brain chemistry, and life events. They stress the importance of seeking professional help for depression, rather than relying on positive thinking and willpower alone.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his statements on mental health, Andrew Tate continues to be a popular figure among his fans, who admire his confidence and self-assuredness.

For example, he once said, “Being poor is a mindset. You can’t be successful if you think like a poor person.” This quote has been met with criticism, as many people believe that poverty is not just a mindset, but a result of systemic issues such as income inequality and lack of access to resources.</p><h3><span id=Success_and_Controversy>Success and Controversy</span></h3><p>Tate has also made headlines for his controversial views on success. In one interview, he said, “Success is the only thing that matters. If you’re not successful, you’re nothing.” This quote has been criticized for promoting a toxic view of success, one that values material wealth over personal growth and well-being.</p><p>However, Tate has also expressed more nuanced views on success. For example, he once said, “Success is not just about money. It’s about living life on your own terms and doing what you love.” This quote acknowledges that success can mean different things to different people, and that financial success is not the only measure of a fulfilling life.</p><p>Overall, Andrew Tate’s views on wealth and success have been controversial, and some of his quotes have been met with criticism. While he has expressed some problematic views, he has also acknowledged that success can mean different things to different people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKG0rbvBmqOuqJSWwaa%2FjZympmenna61ecCrnGarn6Kybq%2FOp6urp6aav7S1wKVkqq2fqbK0ecGyZJqmlKeyuHnTmqueZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-are-some-controversial-quotes-by-andrew-tate.html&text=What%20Are%20Some%20Controversial%20Quotes%20By%20Andrew%20Tate%3f%20A%20Compilation%20Of%20His%20Most%20Contentious%20Remarks&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-are-some-controversial-quotes-by-andrew-tate.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-are-some-controversial-quotes-by-andrew-tate.html&title=What%20Are%20Some%20Controversial%20Quotes%20By%20Andrew%20Tate%3f%20A%20Compilation%20Of%20His%20Most%20Contentious%20Remarks" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-are-some-controversial-quotes-by-andrew-tate.html&title=What%20Are%20Some%20Controversial%20Quotes%20By%20Andrew%20Tate%3f%20A%20Compilation%20Of%20His%20Most%20Contentious%20Remarks" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-are-some-controversial-quotes-by-andrew-tate.html&title=What%20Are%20Some%20Controversial%20Quotes%20By%20Andrew%20Tate%3f%20A%20Compilation%20Of%20His%20Most%20Contentious%20Remarks" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-are-some-controversial-quotes-by-andrew-tate.html&description=What%20Are%20Some%20Controversial%20Quotes%20By%20Andrew%20Tate%3f%20A%20Compilation%20Of%20His%20Most%20Contentious%20Remarks" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./arnold-schwarzenegger-admits-affair-with-brigitte-nielsen-in-total-recall.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Arnold Schwarzenegger Admits Affair with Brigitte Nielsen in Total Recall">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bob-saget-playfully-recaps-year-with-his-wife-in-final-instagram-post-of-couple-together.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bob Saget playfully recaps year with his wife in final Instagram post of couple together">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
