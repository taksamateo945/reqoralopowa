Not only has Richards faced accusations of not being authentic about her private life, but former RHOBH cast member <a href=#>Brandi Glanville</a> has made repeated claims that she and Richards had a sexual relationship.</p><p>During a recent appearance on the Variety After-Show, RHOBH newbie <a href=#>Garcelle Beauvais</a> revealed that things escalated quickly during the cast trip to Rome.</p><p></p><p>“When we went to Rome, it’s just like all bets were off. Everybody was coming after her [Richards]. She was crying at every dinner, and it was a lot,” dished Beauvais, adding that most cast members sided with Glanville.</p><p>Beauvais admitted that it was “really interesting” that everyone took Glanville’s side over Richards because she is their friend.</p><p>“At least wait ‘til you know what’s really happening before you take sides, but they took sides right out of the gate,” said Beauvais.</p><p>During her rookie season on RHOBH, Beauvais has been candid about her troubled relationship with her dad. He has been mostly absent in her life, and the actress says that has influenced how she parents her children.</p><p>Beauvais says there has been “no equation” where her kids weren’t going to have their dad in their lives. And, as a black mother, she has also had lengthy conversations with her three sons about how to interact with law enforcement.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CCYecrSJ_ce/</p><p>She explained that a few months back, a cop pulled her over for making an illegal right turn while her 12-year-old son Jax was in the car with her.</p><p>“I’m so grateful that he was in the backseat because he got to see my interaction. He got to see that my hands were at the wheel. He actually heard me say, ‘I’m reaching for my wallet,’” recalled Beauvais.</p><p>She still finds it frustrating that she has to say something like that when interacting with the police because it’s something her white friends wouldn’t have to worry about. Beauvais also shared that she has faced her share of discrimination in the entertainment industry</p><p>After more than three decades in Hollywood, Beauvais – who will soon star in Coming 2 America with Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall – says that she has only recently been confident enough to ask for equal pay.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CCR1jXypjFr/</p><p>“It’s all about being treated equally. I want to be promoted the same way. I want to be compensated the same way… I’ve been in Hollywood over 20 something years, which is a feat in itself to continue working and I’m so grateful. But I do feel that so many times, my white counterparts get paid 1,000% more than I do. I know it for sure, and that really sucks. We’re not valued as we should be,” said Beauvais.</p><p>She continued by saying that she feels like this has been happening for a long time, but now she is not putting up with it. If someone can’t see her value, then they don’t get to have her in their project.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>New episodes of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills air Wednesday nights on Bravo.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinbyjtIygmKublaG5pnnBnpiurpGewG6wyKyfnqtdpLtuv8SaqqimXWZ9br%2FAsqpmq5iaeqq%2Fza1kr5mcqrKledOhnGarkaKybq3SZp%2Beql2starAxGaaqK2eqbKzvMCrq6xlmaN6qbvLpbCwp5%2BZenV9k25rcGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frhobh-garcelle-beauvais-dishes-on-season-10-says-she-isnt-valued-the-same-as-her-white-counterparts-in-hollywood-414547.html&text=RHOBH%20%20Garcelle%20Beauvais%20Dishes%20On%20Season%2010%2c%20Says%20She%20Isnt%20Valued%20The%20Same%20As%20Her%20White%20Count&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frhobh-garcelle-beauvais-dishes-on-season-10-says-she-isnt-valued-the-same-as-her-white-counterparts-in-hollywood-414547.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frhobh-garcelle-beauvais-dishes-on-season-10-says-she-isnt-valued-the-same-as-her-white-counterparts-in-hollywood-414547.html&title=RHOBH%20%20Garcelle%20Beauvais%20Dishes%20On%20Season%2010%2c%20Says%20She%20Isnt%20Valued%20The%20Same%20As%20Her%20White%20Count" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frhobh-garcelle-beauvais-dishes-on-season-10-says-she-isnt-valued-the-same-as-her-white-counterparts-in-hollywood-414547.html&title=RHOBH%20%20Garcelle%20Beauvais%20Dishes%20On%20Season%2010%2c%20Says%20She%20Isnt%20Valued%20The%20Same%20As%20Her%20White%20Count" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frhobh-garcelle-beauvais-dishes-on-season-10-says-she-isnt-valued-the-same-as-her-white-counterparts-in-hollywood-414547.html&title=RHOBH%20%20Garcelle%20Beauvais%20Dishes%20On%20Season%2010%2c%20Says%20She%20Isnt%20Valued%20The%20Same%20As%20Her%20White%20Count" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frhobh-garcelle-beauvais-dishes-on-season-10-says-she-isnt-valued-the-same-as-her-white-counterparts-in-hollywood-414547.html&description=RHOBH%20%20Garcelle%20Beauvais%20Dishes%20On%20Season%2010%2c%20Says%20She%20Isnt%20Valued%20The%20Same%20As%20Her%20White%20Count" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10081327-lebron-james-calls-out-rich-paul-haters-after-agent-lands-390m-in-nba-fa-contracts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="LeBron James Calls Out Rich Paul Haters After Agent Lands $390M+ in NBA FA Contracts | News, Scores,">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./165404-boity-thulos-reaction-elon-musks-domain-6-loggo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Boity Thulo Jabs at Elon Musks Twitter Logo Changes, Tweet Draws Humorous Reaction From Tweeps">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
