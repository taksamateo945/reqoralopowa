Savran had recently made a heartfelt announcement regarding a medical procedure he had undergone.</p><p>Throughout the years, Savran had faced various health challenges, including his public battle with lung cancer, which he disclosed last year. Additionally, he underwent amputation <a href=#>surgery</a> on his right foot. Despite his resilience, the complications arising from these health issues ultimately led to his passing.</p><p>Savran had a significant presence in Pittsburgh sports broadcasting, hosting a popular weekday talk show on 970 ESPN. From noon to 2 p.m., he captivated audiences with his insights and commentary. His contributions to the local sports scene date back to January 1976, coinciding with the Pittsburgh Steelers’ initial victory on their path to winning six Super Bowls.</p><p>In a candid Facebook message, Savran shared that he was in the hospital, undergoing recovery, and anticipated a lengthy period of rehabilitation in various facilities. He expressed regret over his inability to connect with his audience on a daily basis during this time. However, he remained determined to regain his health and resume hosting his beloved daily show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-09.09.42.png><h2><span id=What_Happened_to_Stan_Savran>What Happened to Stan Savran?</span></h2><p>It is with deep sadness that Pittsburgh’s Action News 4 reports the passing of the esteemed sportscaster, Stan Savran. Throughout his career, Stan Savran left a lasting impact on the Pittsburgh sports scene.</p><p>He began his journey in various radio positions within the city before joining WTAE-TV, where he spent a decade as a valued member of the team during the 1980s. Following his time at WTAE-TV, Savran continued his involvement in sports broadcasting as a Pittsburgh Penguins analyst on AT&T Sports Network, even collaborating with former Pittsburgh’s Action Sports reporter, Guy Junker.</p><p>In more recent years, Savran demonstrated his versatility by hosting pre-and post-game shows for both the Penguins and the Pirates on AT&T Sports Network. His dedication and adaptability in covering multiple sports earned him a well-deserved place in the Western Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame.</p><p>Steelers President Art Rooney II expressed his condolences, saying, “This is a somber day for the City of Pittsburgh as we mourn the loss of Stan Savran, a legendary individual, media icon, and dear friend. He embodied true gentlemanly qualities and made immense contributions to our city and Western Pennsylvania through his honest commentary and extensive knowledge of both local and national sports.”</p><h2><span id=How_Did_Stan_Savran_Die>How Did Stan Savran Die?</span></h2><p>Stan Savran, a beloved and influential figure in Pittsburgh’s sports broadcasting realm for nearly half a century, has passed away at the age of 76. The news of his death was shared by WTAE-TV, where Savran had served as a sports anchor during the 1980s.</p><p>While an official cause of death has not been disclosed, Savran had been open about his battle with lung cancer in recent years. He called the suburb of Upper St. Clair his home, residing there in the southern part of the city.</p><p>Known affectionately as the “Godfather” of Pittsburgh sports, Savran became deeply ingrained in the city’s sports scene after relocating from Cleveland in 1976. He initially embarked on a radio career before transitioning to television, occasionally venturing into newspaper columns as well.</p><p>Savran’s most notable role was as the co-host of the highly esteemed “SportsBeat” show, which aired on regional cable from 1991 to 2009. The program became a cherished staple for passionate fans of Pittsburgh’s professional sports teams.</p><p>It was customary for callers to begin their conversations with the phrase, “Stan, Guy, love the show,” a sentiment that Savran held dear, even long after the show concluded its extensive run.</p><h2><span id=Stan_Savran_Cause_of_Death>Stan Savran Cause of Death</span></h2><p>The exact cause of Stan Savran’s death has not been officially disclosed to the public. Although Savran had been open about his fight against lung cancer, no confirmation has been provided regarding whether his battle with cancer directly led to his passing.</p><p>Lung cancer is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease that can give rise to various complications. While it is possible that his health condition played a role, it is important to respect the privacy of Savran’s family and allow them to share any additional information about the cause of his death according to their wishes.</p><h2><span id=Who_was_Stan_Savran>Who was Stan Savran?</span></h2><p>Stan Savran, originally known as Stanley George Savransky, was a highly respected media personality based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His significant contributions to the sports industry earned him induction into the Western Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame and the Pittsburgh Pirates Media Wall of Fame.</p><p>Born on February 25, 1947, Savran began his career in radio after graduating from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. He held various positions in Columbus, Lawton (OK), and Orlando (FL). In Orlando, he worked as a play-by-play announcer for the World Football League from 1974 to 1975.</p><p>In January 1976, Savran responded to a “blind” advertisement for a radio sportscaster in Broadcasting magazine, which marked his entry into the Pittsburgh sports scene. He initially worked at WWSW-AM but later moved to KQV when WWSW changed its format in 1979. From 1981 to 1991, he served as a dedicated sports reporter for WTAE-TV, delivering sports news from both the news desk and various locations.</p><p>Savran also hosted a talk show on WTAE Radio (now WPGP) from 8 to 9 p.m. during that time. This era, often referred to as the “Golden Era of Pittsburgh sports talk,” was notable for Savran’s exceptional skills and in-depth knowledge. After a disagreement with management, he left for KBL/Fox Sports Net.</p><p>From 2000 to 2004, Savran contributed weekly sports columns to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the city’s largest newspaper. Throughout his career, he also served as a sports anchor for WTAE-TV and WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh. He hosted intermission segments during Pittsburgh Penguins broadcasts when the games aired on WPGH, and he continued to make occasional appearances in the same capacity for AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh.</p><h2 class=faq_title><span id=Stan_Savran_Illness-FAQs>Stan Savran Illness-FAQs</span></h2><h3 class=faq_qus><span id=Who_was_Stan_Savran1>Who was Stan Savran?</span></h3><p>Stan Savran, born Stanley George Savransky on February 25, 1947, was a highly regarded media personality based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p><h3 class=faq_qus><span id=How_Did_Stan_Savran_Die1>&nbsp;How Did Stan Savran Die?</span></h3><p>&nbsp;No official cause of death was disclosed, Savran had been open about his battle with lung cancer in recent years.
