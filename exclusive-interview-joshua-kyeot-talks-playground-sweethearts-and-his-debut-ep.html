The song follows up his debut single “Only One”, and the 2015 viral track from Tyde, which he featured on, titled “Anything”. He floods his songs with soul, so much so that we just had to grab an interview with him.</p><p>His new song has certainly got us talking. “<a href=#>Playground Sweethearts</a>” is a loving track with a stunning vocal. We really believe that Joshua KYEOT has a chance to bring something big to the music industry as he continues to make his dreams a reality.</p><p>In our exclusive interview, Joshua KYEOT talks about his brand new single, the EP he has been working on that is titled “She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not”, and what he hopes 2018 will bring.</p><p><strong>Hi there, Joshua. We hope all is well with you. What have you been up to recently?</strong></p><p>Recently I have been working on promoting my EP “She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not”. It is my very first project so naturally, I am excited.</p><p><strong>What got you into music in the first place?</strong></p><p>I think it was just the way I felt when I heard music. The coolness of it. And the fact that it is a feature of life. I wanted to contribute to someone’s life in a way other musicians and artist have contributed to mine.</p><p><strong>Your brand-new single is “Playground Sweethearts” can you tell us more about the song?</strong></p><p>Yeah, it is inspired by feelings of regret in the realm of love. Where two kids have grown, and the boy who never spoke about his feelings before, is speaking up now and taking a chance. He just cannot bear to live with the regret.</p><p><strong>It follows up your debut single “Only One”, how does your new song differ from your debut?</strong></p><p>Sonically, I think they are quite similar. Quite dreamy, about love, smooth. The differences are in the personas. In “Only One”, the persona is more confident and has been stricken by a dame. The flirtation is a lot more sexual between them; whereas, in&nbsp;“Playground Sweethearts”, the persona is a lot more naïve. It is about nostalgia and puppy love even.</p><p><strong>What inspired you when it came to this song?</strong></p><p>It was inspired by the story of young love, and the aspiration to live my life as the type of person who doesn’t have any regrets that have arisen from being afraid to do something.</p><p><strong>Which lyrics are your favourite from the track?</strong></p><p>From playing ‘kiss-chase’ in the park</p><p>From daylight up till dark</p><p>It was you and me right from the start</p><p>Playground Sweethearts.</p><p>I think the rhymes just nicely start the song and set the scene quite well. These are the first lyrics of the song, right out of the gate. I think these lyrics are also reflective of my writing style in general, as I like to tell stories, and I am a bit of a romantic.</p><p><strong>Where do you get your inspiration from when it comes to your music?</strong></p><p>From all sorts. I think I am a rather imaginative and connected person. I sub-consciously draw from talking to people about their lives, and their stories and experiences just resonate with me on a deep level sometimes. I want to be able to relay that emotion to people, whether it is a lyric or something more sonic that does that.</p><p><strong>Which singers do you look up to?</strong></p><p>I’d say I admire the plethora of musicians and singers that came before me, I don’t think I ‘look up to’ anyone anymore. I have admiration for those that came before me and those are singing now. Sisqo is probably worth mentioning because I think he really made me want to sing. And Prince, always.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/exclusive-interview-joshua-kyeot-talks-playground-sweethearts-and-his-debut-ep-02-682x1024.jpg alt width=662 height=994 sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What are your top five favourite tracks to listen to right now?</strong></p><p>As much as I love fresh music, I’ve been mostly listening to some great old school stuff lately. Some Daft Punk, Prince, classical works etc.</p><p>Yebba’s “Evergreen” is definitely one of my favourite new songs though, she is an amazing singer and the arrangement on that track is just beautiful.</p><p><strong>What has been your highlight of your career so far?</strong></p><p>Releasing my second single “Playground Sweethearts”. Truly a milestone and something I am extremely proud of. You dig?</p><p><strong>What do you hope to achieve with your music?</strong></p><p>I hope to inspire people to want to do things that make them happy. I hope to make people feel like Stevie [Wonder] makes me feel when I listen to “Sir Duke”. I want to make you want to get up and add to the world in some way!</p><p><strong>As 2018 brings us a tonne of new music, along with your brand new single, what else can we expect from you this year?</strong></p><p>“She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not”, my debut project will be released this year. I am super proud of it. I put a lot of hours into getting it ready. I can’t wait for people to hear it and feel something.</p><p>I hope to be on stage a whole lot more, axe in hand, singing my heart out. More music, more creating, more love.</p><p><strong>Finally, do you have a message for your fans?</strong></p><p>Yes! Go and listen to my song “<a href=#>Playground Sweethearts</a>“. I hope that it moves you. Keep your eyes on my socials for all info on the release of my EP “She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not”, along with merchandise and CDs too.</p><p>Thank you for all of your support. There is a lot more to come and hope to see you from a stage soon!</p><p>You can follow Joshua KYEOT on <a href=#>Facebook</a>, <a href=#>Twitter</a>, <a href=#>Instagram</a>, and <a href=#>Soundcloud</a>. “<a href=#>Playground Sweethearts</a>” is <a href=#>available to download and stream right now</a>, with his EP following later on in the year.</p><p>Thank you, Joshua KYEOT for answering our questions.
