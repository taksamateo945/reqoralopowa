The couple recently enlarged their family circle by welcoming their second son, Axel Fumero in 2020.</p><h3><strong>Enzo Fumero’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Age:</strong> 7 Years Old</li><li><strong>Birthday:</strong> 24th of March 2016</li><li><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Havana, Cuba in Northern America</li><li><strong>Birth Sign:</strong> Aries</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Latino</li><li><strong>Father:</strong> David Fumero</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Melissa Fumero</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Axel Fumero</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Enzo Fumero Now?</strong></h2><p>Enzo Fumero was born on the 24th of March 2016 which puts his age at 7. He was born in Havana, Cuba, and is Cuban by nationality. He is of Latino ethnicity. Enzo’s name means ruler of the house.</p><p>He is the son of Cuban-American actress and director, Melissa Fumero. An alum of New York University, Melissa started her acting career on the set of One Life to Live, and today, she had appeared in notable productions like Brooklyn Nine-Nine, M.O.D.O.K, and more.</p><p>The youngster’s dad has been identified as David Fumero who is also part of the entertainment industry as an actor cum model. David shared the screen with his wife, Melissa in One Life to Live and has played notable roles in productions like Power, Burnside, Cristian Vega, and more.</p><p>The 7-year-old Enzo is already of school age and has commenced his academic pursuit. However, the academic institution he attends is kept under wraps.</p><h2><strong>Enzo Fumero’s Parents’ Relationship is Still Going Strong</strong></h2><p>Enzo Fumero’s parents are married. The duo first crossed paths while filming their roles in One Life to Live. Melissa, who already vowed not to date another Cuban guy after getting disappointed by her previous boyfriend didn’t give David a chance to get close. She kept pretending she didn’t understand the Spanish he was speaking in other to discourage him.</p><p>However, Melissa’s friends came to the rescue when they found out she was giving the poor guy attitude. They made her know that David was a nice and humble guy and today, Mellissa is glad she heeded their advice.</p><p>When they eventually went on their first date, Enzo’s mum had a feeling that she was talking to somebody from her past. With time, it dawned on the Cuban actress that she once had a crush on David while he was working as an MTV model in his younger days and that experience cemented their relationship. The couple became officially engaged towards the end of 2006 and they tied the knot in New Jersey on December 9, 2007. Their union has endured for over 14 years and still going strong.</p><h2><strong>Enzo Has Another Brother Named Axel</strong></h2><p>Four years after they had their first child, Enzo Fumero, David and Melissa decided to enlarge their family circle. The couple’s second son, Axel Fumero arrived on the 14th of February 2020. It was a double celebration for the couple as it was Valentine’s Day. On the sight of her bundle of joy, Mellissa soon forgot all the difficulties she experienced during her pregnancy</p><p>According to the Cuban-American actress, Axel means father of peace, claiming that both Enzo and Axel’s names match their personalities perfectly.</p><p>Both David and Melissa are doting parents and are forever talking about their boys. The Cuban-American actress said she marvels at how David can play with their boys with his inexhaustible energy. He can swoop on a screaming Axel and his cry will turn to laughter like magic.</p><p>The couple seems to have no qualms about sharing stuff concerning their kids on social media as several images and videos of them have been spotted.</p><h3><strong>Is Enzo Fumero on any career Path Yet?</strong></h3><p>Enzo Fumero is probably too young to decide on a career path at age 7. However, many are already speculating that he may end up following his parents into the movie world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqmsdNmnKeyn2KztrnEq6ZmpZWhtrS%2FwGadrqWVp7y0edKopWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeet-enzo-fumero-melissa-fumeros-son.html&text=Meet%20Enzo%20Fumero%2c%20Melissa%20Fumero%27s%20Son&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-enzo-fumero-melissa-fumeros-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-enzo-fumero-melissa-fumeros-son.html&title=Meet%20Enzo%20Fumero%2c%20Melissa%20Fumero%27s%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeet-enzo-fumero-melissa-fumeros-son.html&title=Meet%20Enzo%20Fumero%2c%20Melissa%20Fumero%27s%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-enzo-fumero-melissa-fumeros-son.html&title=Meet%20Enzo%20Fumero%2c%20Melissa%20Fumero%27s%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-enzo-fumero-melissa-fumeros-son.html&description=Meet%20Enzo%20Fumero%2c%20Melissa%20Fumero%27s%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10119276-buying-or-selling-yankees-biggest-breakout-players-in-2024-season.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Buying or Selling Yankees' Biggest Breakout Players in 2024 Season | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./park-sung-hoon-pets.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Park Sung-hoon Pets - Celebrity Pets">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
