Women wore them as symbols of commitment to their spouses. The custom changed during World War II. Soldiers put on wedding rings before they left for war. They were symbols of eternal love for their wives if they died on the battlefield. Should a man buy his own wedding ring? The customs of the families whose children were getting married determined how they handled the matter. In many communities, the brides' families bought the mens wedding rings. Today, the couple or their families agree on what to do.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/a727a6da9234d092.jpg><p class=align-left>Couples conformed to specific rings depending on the meanings that their communities attached to the bands. While some conservative people still respect <a href=# title="Mens wedding rings">their customs</a> in this era, others dropped their traditions. They attach personal meanings to wedding bands and choose whichever band attracts them.</p><h2>Affordable mens wedding bands</h2><p class=align-left>What is the best mens wedding ring? Although most men pick tungsten bands, they compromise if they cannot get what they want. Brides treasure unique but affordable rings; hence, they might demand distinct mens wedding bands for their fiancés. A couple should take a look at the following <a href=# title="mens wedding rings" rel="nofollow noopener">types of wedding rings</a> for men to make an informed decision.</p><h3>Leather wedding rings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/44863870c4b2bbae.jpg><p class=align-left>You may be surprised to learn that people wear leather rings in this era. Many people are fascinated by these wedding bands; hence, they try them on and get used to them. Some couples need leather bands for their <a href=# title="Mens wedding rings">traditional marriage </a>ceremonies.</p><h3>Gold wedding bands</h3><p class=align-left>Gold rings symbolize wealth and luck in many cultures globally. Although they will remain trendy and valuable for generations, they are not the most expensive bands. There are several <a href=# title="mens wedding rings" rel="nofollow noopener">gold shades </a>like kiwi, nectar, vegas, Inca, and Yuma. There are various<a href=# title="mens wedding rings" rel="nofollow noopener"> gold-plated rings</a> from the overlay, filled, layered, to vermeil. Below are other types of mens wedding bands that will interest you.</p><h4><strong>Yellow gold rings</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/2519582416e2f71c.jpg><p class=align-left>They are made from a combination of zinc, copper, and pure gold. Pure gold bands get scratched quickly because they are too soft. Wedding rings made of a mixture of gold and other metals last longer.</p><h4><strong>Red gold rings</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/5e09c6cc4b82dd18.jpg><p class=align-left>Varieties of copper amounts are mixed with pure copper alloys to create varying shades of red, pink, and rose gold bands. Choose your wedding band wisely because some are coated with gold, yet they are made of other alloys.</p><h4><strong>White gold rings</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/c86cfbebd9828b37.jpg><p class=align-left>Pick white gold bands when you are on a budget but have good taste. They are created from a mixture of pure gold with Palladium, nickel, and silver. The sparkling surface of the bands is long-lasting.</p><h4><strong>Black gold rings</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/ecfe2316b568448c.jpg><p class=align-left>Oxidized gold turns black when mixed with chromium or cobalt. The gold alloy is treated with potassium sulphide to transform into various shades of brown. It can also be decorated with a variety of gemstones.</p><h3>Silver wedding rings</h3><p class=align-left>Silver represents ageing and the elderly; hence these bands are<a href=# title="Mens wedding rings"> perfect for couples</a> that want to grow old together. Pure silver is too soft to make durable wedding bands. Avoid specific silver men wedding rings if your skin is easily irritable by metals. Silver male wedding rings come in various hues from roman, chalice, blueberry, and more. Below are the<a href=# title="mens wedding rings" rel="nofollow noopener"> types of silver alloys </a>that are used to make wedding bands.</p><h4><strong>Sterling silver rings</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/76cbd72008ef9cd2.jpg><p class=align-left>They are grey-white or bright-white and easy to polish. The bands change colour and darken because they oxidize. These bands are made of 92.5% pure silver and 7.5% copper to increase their durability. Non-sterling silver bands are less shiny because they have low amounts of pure silver.</p><h4><strong>Nickel silver rings</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/4980be81435084d4.jpg><p class=align-left>They are inexpensive, but some dubious traders sell them as sterling silver bands because of the metals' striking resemblance. You should consult wedding band experts before buying this band to ensure that it is real.</p><h4><strong>Tribal silver rings</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/44e55f2f47a3b2ed.jpg><p class=align-left>These bands are made from a combination of other metals on the market. They contain low amounts of silver, while some have no silver alloy, and people wear them during particular <a href=# title="Mens wedding rings">traditional occasions</a>.</p><h4><strong>Coin silver rings</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/7e68888fcc73ad7b.jpg><p class=align-left>They are rare to find, and they tarnish quickly. These bands are made from copper and silver or recycled old coins. The wedding bands are also made from a combination of different types of coins to create unique designs.</p><h4><strong>Argentium silver rings</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/5251cecd873ed7c8.jpg><p class=align-left>Copper and germanium are mixed with Argentium silver alloy to increase the bands' resistance to oxidation and ease to polish. Argentium is easily available; therefore, its bands are affordable and a better alternative to save money.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Fine silver rings</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/0fdf9ef55f5fe106.jpg><p class=align-left>These bands are lustrous and white, but they change shape quickly. They are easy to resize; therefore, you should not get worried when they change shape. 99.9% of the ring is silver, while 0.1% is a mixture of other elements.</p><h3>Rhodium wedding rings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/4449b3979c1ebdd5.jpg><p class=align-left>The difference between something good and great lies in the details of the designs. It requires a lot of expertise to plate a rhodium ring with different materials on different parts like the one in the image above.</p><h3>Platinum wedding bands</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/0f15d8bfe57b08d5.jpg><p class=align-left>They signify physical beauty and class. Platinum rings are heavier but more durable than most wedding bands. Their white shininess compliments all types of gemstones. The metal is rarer to find than gold; hence its bands are more expensive than gold rings.</p><h3>Titanium wedding bands</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/56e16c8992fa45d5.jpg><p class=align-left>They are the most popular bands because they last longer than gold and silver. The rings neither rust nor crack, and they are hypo-allergic. Titanium is light in weight; therefore, it suits those who wear rings for long hours.</p><h3>Palladium wedding rings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/ee4cd4a2f4819c41.jpg><p class=align-left>Palladium rings have low maintenance costs because they possess a non-tarnishing natural whiteness, and they are scratch-resistant. These bands are hypo-allergenic; hence you can wear them all the time without experiencing itchiness.</p><h3>Tungsten wedding rings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/a50f146fe7f9dbed.jpg><p class=align-left>Tungsten is harder than titanium and platinum; hence it is hard to polish or engrave. The metal varies from steel-grey to white, and its wedding bands do not cause skin reactions. Get a perfect fit for titanium and tungsten rings because they cannot be resized. Mens tungsten wedding bands are popular because they do not show scratch marks.</p><h3>Wooden wedding rings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/414f01b1ec62b907.jpg><p class=align-left>A combination of wood with metals makes trendy bands that are classy and comfortable to wear for days without taking them off the fingers. You can also choose to wears bands that are made of pure wood.</p><h3>Stainless steel wedding rings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/09caed73102e03f6.jpg><p class=align-left>Would you wear these wedding bands on your special day?

Wedding ring designers create a unique finishing that matches their client's specifications. Below are the most common wedding ring finishing designs.</p><h3>Polished</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/2fc6b1050b8929e1.jpg><p class=align-left>Its surface is smooth, shiny, and reflective, like a clear dressing mirror. The ring is easy to maintain if your hands rarely touch or work with rough surfaces. However, you can re-polish it whenever it loses its smooth and shiny look.</p><h3>Satin</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/878a505b01a17e0e.jpg><p class=align-left>The band is smooth like polished rings but not shiny. You cannot see clear reflections of objects on it because the surface is like a fogged mirror. Scratches on the surface cannot distort its beautiful appearance.</p><h3>Brushed</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/77f4b60eca01f070.jpg><p class=align-left>It appears to be as smooth as a satin ring, but you can feel the finishing's texture when you touch it tenderly. The ring's surface is not too rough to scratch your skin. Its interior is smooth and gentle on the finger.</p><h3>Hammered</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/9ca80c4b5782f369.jpg><p class=align-left>They are men's favourite rings because they are unique and non-shiny. The dimples on the bands' surfaces look like a hammer pounded them. They are the best wedding bands for couples that adore simplicity.</p><h3>Wire-brushed</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/3c7bad7982b22ad5.jpg><p class=align-left>It almost resembles a brushed ring, and it is common among men. You can quickly and easily differentiate it from a brushed wedding band because a wire-brushed ring's cover is more visible than a brushed surface.</p><h3>Sandblasted</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/02a023d6d27be7e4.jpg><p class=align-left>The ring stands out because of the intense rough finishing. You will feel an acute grainy texture on the outside when you run your fingertips on it gently. Although the surface of the wedding band is rough, it is simply irresistible to wear.</p><h3>What are the most precious stones for rings?</h3><p class=align-left>People <a id=https://www.gemsociety.org/article/10-famous-colored-gemstone-engagement-rings/ href=# title="mens wedding rings" rel="nofollow noopener">have been wearing </a>gemstone rings from time immemorial, and the most precious <a id=https://www.onefabday.com/az-guide-alternative-gemstones-engagement-rings/ href=# title="mens wedding rings" rel="nofollow noopener">gemstones for men rings</a> are diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and sapphires.
