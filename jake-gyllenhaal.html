Definitely, it’s in expression and creativity where my family has always been best at.” Gyllenhaal graduated from the Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles in 1998, then attended Columbia University, where his sister was a senior and from which his mother had graduated, to study Eastern religions and philosophy. Gyllenhaal dropped out after two years to concentrate on acting but has expressed intentions to eventually finish his degree.

He made his acting debut as Billy Crystal’s son in the 1991 comedy City Slickers.

In his theatrical debut, Gyllenhaal starred on the London stage in Kenneth Lonergan’s revival of This Is Our Youth at the Garrick Theatre in 2002. Gyllenhaal said, “Every actor I look up to has done theatre work, so I knew I had to give it a try.” The play, which had been a critical sensation on Broadway, ran for eight weeks in London’s West End.
